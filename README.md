# ace-attorney-discord-bot-rust
This was an attempt to re-write parts of the [ace attorney discord bot](https://github.com/LuisMayo/ace-attorney-discord-bot) in Rust, aiming to be more memory-efficient. However, once it reached MVP state, a real-time test using the production env was run. The rust port did not only not improve the situations in respect to the Python bot. But it was actually worse. With that in mind this project was halted indefinitely.
